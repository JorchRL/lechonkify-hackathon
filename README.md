# lechonkify microservice

This project is a (very) small microservice you can add to your app to have your users "lechonkify" their profile pictures to show their love for Lechonk!!! :3

The app itself is made with Node.js. And it is being deployed to a Kubernetes cluster on Linode

This is an entry to the HashnodeXLinode Hackathon!
